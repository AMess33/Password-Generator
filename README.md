## Add javaScript code to allow the website to create a unique and random password that fits the users character requirements

- I want to create javaScript code to enable a user to create a random and secure password.
- I built this so users would have a tool to create a secure, unique, and tryly random password given their own character prefrences such as length and type of characters used. 
- This will make user passwords harder to hack because they are truly random and unique.
- I learned how to create multiple functions in JavaScript that would allow the webpage to save user inputs into variables to be used in future functions.



## Usage

[Password Generator Webpage](https://amess33.github.io/Password-Generator/)

When you open the webpage, you will click on the 'Generate Password' button and follow the on screen prompts to give your prefrences on length of password as well as which characters you want to be included.

After you answer all of the on screen prompts your unique password will be displayed in the text box on screen for you to copy.
